## Pure Bliss

Was plaing around with `say` one sleep deprived evening and thought I should make
a script which alleviates my mood every time I remember about it. This is the result.

Simply clone the repo and run linkScriptForMac as sudo.

N.B.:
- I've only written the script for mac currently. Will do one for ubuntu when I remember.
- symlink script is very basic. Does not handle errors nor install. All in time.

I wonder if this is detrimental to my career
